## Introduction
Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. This repository aims to provide clear and simple example of each design pattern implemented in C#.

## Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns
- Will update once developed

### Structural Patterns
- **Decorator**: The decorator pattern is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the new behaviors.

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
